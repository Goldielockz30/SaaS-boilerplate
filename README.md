## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

To start your own clean project using this boilerplate:

First, open a bash terminal and choose where you want your project folder to live (e.g. Desktop, Documents, etc.)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop  # or wherever you keep your projects
git clone https://github.com/Goldielockz30/SaaS-boilerplate.git my-saas-app
cd my-saas-app/scripts/setup-local-boilerplate
bash setup-local-boilerplate.sh
```

## 📂 Project Structure

See [folder-structure.md](./docs/folder-structure.md) for a full visual breakdown of the repo layout.

---

## ⚙️ Quickstart

1. Clone this repo
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
3. Create and activate your Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
4. Install backend dependencies and frontend packages
5. Start development with Docker or run backend and frontend separately
6. Use the included scripts and Git hooks for smooth workflow

For detailed setup and usage, see the docs in the `docs/` folder.

## 🔐 Why `.env` Is In The Root Folder

The `.env` file contains your project’s environment variables — sensitive information like API keys and secret tokens. Keeping it in the root folder:

- Makes it easy to locate and manage all environment variables in one place
- Ensures backend and frontend parts can access variables as needed
- Allows tools like Docker, FastAPI, and frontend frameworks to load variables automatically

`.env.example` is a template included to show which variables are needed, with placeholder values for safe sharing. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in real secrets locally. `.env` is ignored by Git to protect sensitive data.
